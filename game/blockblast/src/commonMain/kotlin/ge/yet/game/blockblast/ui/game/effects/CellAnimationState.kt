     * is FastOutSlowInEasing throughout (no linear "snap" feel), durations
     * are stretched to ~250ms total, and the recoil springs use a high
     * damping ratio so they settle without ringing.

     * Previous more aggressive version (scaleX 1.25 / scaleY 0.65, recoil
     * 1.18) made adjacent cells of multi-cell pieces overlap each other
     * mid-animation — looked like ghost cells appearing.
     *
     * The per-cell (x+y) * 25L wave delay used at the call site was also
     * dropped: staggering the squash across cells of a single piece made
     * the visual collision much worse.
