# Fruit Merge

Fruit Merge is an original, deterministic drop-and-merge MiniApp for Funfolio. Tap anywhere in the
game viewport to drop the preview fruit, or drag horizontally and release to choose its position.
Equal fruit combine into the next level. Keep every fruit below the danger line; a continuous
1.5-second overflow ends the run. Accepted drops have a 450 ms cooldown so fruit cannot be spammed
into an unresolved airborne stack.

Each new run includes five clears and three shakes. After those free actions are spent, the same
action passes through the host interstitial gate. When advertising is disabled or unavailable, the
host completes the gate immediately. Clear removes one selected fruit. Shake runs for 2.25 seconds,
applies five bounded deterministic impulses through the ordinary fixed-step physics, and disables
its control until the sequence finishes so one request consumes exactly one attempt.

The regular play surface is icon-first. A compact score/best strip sits above an action row with
Bomb, Vibration, and a truthful queued Next fruit; the controls are outside the glass and compact
badges communicate remaining free uses or the advertising gate. A persisted two-step, pass-through
tutorial uses the measured board position, a light spotlight, a concise instruction card, and a
reduced-motion static cue without blocking the board. Overflow navigates to a
dedicated Decompose Result destination with the score, best score, largest fruit, and one New game
action. Its full-frame base color also covers host chrome and system-bar regions. The supporting
pane shows the complete ten-fruit evolution chain.

The viewport uses the shared `AdaptiveGameScaffold`: compact windows place the header above an
enlarged, bottom-weighted board and the evolution strip below it, while wide and compact-height
windows move the header and evolution strip into the supporting pane. The board and all
fruit are rendered by one Canvas. Physics advances at a deterministic 60 Hz with a three-step
frame cap, a bounded spatial grid, at most 80 bodies, and no per-fruit coroutine or Compose node.
Reduced-motion settings disable optional blinking and targeting pulses without stopping gameplay
physics; the tutorial uses a static gesture cue and omits its completion burst.

Fruit art is original runtime vector drawing: every level has a unique silhouette/detail/face
identity, a muted orchard base, layered glossy highlights, leaf or rind markings, blush, and an
expressive face that blinks or reacts to impacts and danger. The first three fruits deliberately use
berry, twin-cherry, and seeded-heart silhouettes so they remain distinguishable at small sizes. The
catalog icon is an original vector in the same visual language.

Music and SFX are original procedural declarations rendered through the session-bound MiniApp audio
API. The 84 BPM music evokes a hand-shaken fruit crate using wooden knocks, rolling noise, sparse
glass-like accents, and seeded stereo movement. Drop uses a soft low fruit impact with a short
bounce tail; Clear uses a brighter slice/whoosh texture with a rounded pop. Merge tiers, shake, and
game-over keep separate deterministic effects. Acoustic tests validate audibility, headroom,
determinism, temporal decay, and the brighter slice spectrum; no recorded or third-party audio asset
is bundled.

This module does not own production shipping authorization. The maintainer-owned `miniApps`
allowlist in `settings.gradle.kts` is the sole shipping source. Verify the module independently with:
