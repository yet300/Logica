# Mobile audio budgets

The compiler rejects programs beyond the mobile safety envelope. Author below these ceilings rather than treating them as targets.

Practical author budget: begin with one to four music tracks, one or two sources per voice, short tails, and at least 6 dB of subjective headroom. Avoid inaudible layers and redundant oscillators. Reuse a compiled immutable program rather than rebuilding it.

Run `./gradlew :your:module:allTests` and add an acoustic render test when authoring a new voice or preset. Assert deterministic hash for a fixed seed, finite samples, peak below `1f`, a useful RMS range, and the intended stereo/control response. The experimental `MiniAppAudioTestRenderer` is test-only: its typed request renders music, control overrides, and frame-offset SFX triggers through the same bounded realtime mixer used by platform sinks. Requests reject unknown names, duplicate or invalid controls, out-of-range offsets, and oversized collections; returned PCM channels are defensive copies. Keep higher-level analysis such as spectral centroid and pitch direction local to the consuming test.
