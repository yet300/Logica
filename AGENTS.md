# BlockBlast Agent Guide

## Purpose

BlockBlast (published as **Logica — Block Puzzle**) is a Kotlin Multiplatform
block-puzzle game. Kotlin and Compose Multiplatform provide the shared product
and presentation layers for Android and iOS; the Android and SwiftUI shells
host platform SDK integrations.

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical guide for every coding agent, including Codex.
Read it before inspecting or changing the repository. `CLAUDE.md` and
`GEMINI.md` are intentionally thin pointers so their instructions cannot
diverge.

## Start Here

Before changing code:

1. Read this file and the nearest affected module's `build.gradle.kts`.
2. Inspect `settings.gradle.kts` and `gradle/libs.versions.toml` if the work
   affects modules, platforms, plugins, or dependencies.
3. Prefer the codebase knowledge graph for Kotlin code discovery when it is
   available. Index the repository root first if the graph is missing or stale.
4. Read every relevant skill under `.agents/skills/` before changing Kotlin,
   Compose, Decompose, MVIKotlin, Metro, Android, iOS, analytics, or marketing
   work. Use only skills relevant to the requested change.
5. Verify assumptions against source and tests. Do not infer behavior merely
   from the app name, package names, or the version catalog.

For creating or substantially redesigning a puzzle MiniApp, read
`.agents/skills/puzzle-game-creation/SKILL.md` before implementation. It routes
reference research, detailed user interviews, visual/motion samples,
procedural music and SFX, level validation and experience acceptance. Preserve
the user's approved choices and icon-source restrictions; do not silently
replace missing reference evidence with invented mechanics or level counts.

Keep dependencies flowing inward. In particular, core modules must not depend on
features or UI, and feature modules must not depend on `:composeApp` or either
native application shell. Treat a new cross-feature dependency as an
architecture decision, not a convenience import.

Game modules own all rules, game-specific models, persistence, components and
UI for their respective games. `:feature:root` hosts a selected plugin session, while
the game module must not depend on `:composeApp`, `:feature:root` or a native
application module. Block Blast's engine and implementation details stay
`internal`; only the MiniApp plugin, concrete session binding type, child-graph
factory and app binding bridge cross the module boundary. A session binding
type may be public for cross-module Metro aggregation, but its constructor and
state remain internal. Block Blast also owns its transient
Playing/Result, resume, revive and review-opportunity session flow; the common
host remains responsible for leaving the MiniApp.

Games may emit game-specific review opportunities, but `:feature:review` owns
the app-wide prompt limit, persistence, suppression, analytics and store-review request.
`:feature:root` decides when to open the reusable review sheet.

MiniApp Crashlytics context is runtime-scoped and best-effort. Synchronous, caught
MiniApp session-creation failures are recorded as non-fatal exceptions; launch,
close and visibility transitions are diagnostic breadcrumbs and custom values,
not exceptions. Root installs no global exception handler. Normal analytics
remains a separate channel and does not replace Crashlytics context.

Keep monetization policy in `:monetization:core`; it must not depend on Compose,
Firebase, advertising SDKs, or either application shell. Native AdMob and UMP
dependencies belong in `:monetization:ads`. Product configuration, such
as ad unit IDs and the current entitlement, enters through `:composeApp`.

MiniApp dependencies also flow inward. `:miniapp:api` is Compose-free and owns
only stable portable contracts. `:miniapp:compose` depends on that API and owns
the UI-facing plugin/session contracts. `:miniapp:metro` owns the immutable
app-scoped registry and its empty-capable compile-time plugin aggregation; its
session-scope marker is a child lifecycle, not a second game-specific scope.
Block Blast implements `MiniAppPlugin` through a retained Metro child graph;
session-owned components and reducers live in `MiniAppSessionScope`, while save,
best-score and preference repositories remain app-scoped. Each game includes
its own session binding container explicitly on its `@GraphExtension`; do not
contribute game-specific bindings globally to the shared session scope. Game plugins consume
`MiniAppInterstitialCapability` and must not depend on a MiniApp host,
`:feature:root`, `:composeApp`, native application modules or native-ad modules.
`:composeApp` renders every running session inside one host-owned frame. Back,
Settings, toolbar sizing and accessibility, safe-area ownership, system-icon
appearance and the conditional banner stay host-owned. A banner occupies
layout space only while a renderable native creative is mounted; loading, failure,
no-fill and ineligibility occupy zero ad space. A session may contribute optional
center content through `MiniAppSession.TopBarContent`; that content renders in the
resolved session color scheme, outside the plugin viewport. A session may override
only the needed Material color roles through `MiniAppSession.colorScheme`; all
other roles, typography and shapes inherit from Logica. Arbitrary themes nested
inside `MiniAppSession.Content` remain confined to the viewport and cannot leak
into host chrome. Sessions
publish a Decompose `Value<MiniAppFrameMode>` derived from their active internal
child; the default is `Standard`, while screens such as results can select
`ContentOnly` without imperative visibility flags on `MiniAppPlugin` or leaking
game-specific navigation types into the host. Root owns navigation and sheets.
Catalog owns its ambient background. The host always paints the resolved opaque
session background, then lets a MiniApp draw optional decorative art through the
full-frame background layer. System bars remain transparent so the frame and
top app bar draw edge-to-edge beneath system icons; games never manage platform
bars or insets. Root
transitions must preserve those boundaries.

Every plugin receives one `MiniAppSessionContext`, including its lifecycle,
visibility, host callbacks, an ID-bound `MiniAppStorage` and a stale-safe
`MiniAppAudio` facade. Root opens audio before plugin session creation and
closes provisional or destroyed sessions with the same ID/key. MiniApps use
that facade for procedural playback rather than importing platform audio or
reading Settings. Counter is the copyable authoring example. Block Blast is a
legacy exception: its semantic `BlockBlastAudioPlayer` maps game events to its
existing bundled filenames and delegates to the app-owned `AudioRepository`;
its Store still handles neither filenames nor DSP commands. The shared
file-audio pipeline is not a public MiniApp authoring capability.
Persistent values use local snake-case keys and versioned snapshot specs;
MiniApps must not import
`com.russhwolf.settings` or construct physical storage keys. The host-side
`:miniapp:storage` backend owns namespacing and compatibility aliases. When the
user deletes all game data, Root first navigates to Catalog and awaits active
session destruction, keeps the Settings flow visible, and only then performs a
best-effort reset across shipped MiniApp IDs. App preferences, consent,
entitlement and review-policy data are outside those namespaces and survive.

Block Blast drag, grid and tray hit-testing measurements use window
coordinates, reflected by `InWindow` names. Convert points and rectangles only
at viewport-local rendering boundaries through the shared `windowToViewport`
contract; overlay and effect inputs use explicit `InViewport` names.

The root settings `miniApps` allowlist is the sole authoritative shipping path:
the bundle convention consumes its finalized declarations in order, adds exactly
those projects to `commonMainApi` alongside `:miniapp:metro`, and generates the
public `ProductionMiniAppExpectation` contributed to Metro. Block Blast, 2048,
and Fruit Merge are the current allowlist entries and are included in the production
bundle; Counter remains discovered but excluded from the allowlist and
unshipped.
`verifyMiniAppBundle` rejects missing,
unexpected or duplicated bundle dependencies, and allowlisted projects that do
not apply `logica.miniapp`.

For contributor work, read
[`CONTRIBUTING_MINIAPP.md`](CONTRIBUTING_MINIAPP.md) and
[`docs/miniapp/AI_CONTRIBUTOR_PROTOCOL.md`](docs/miniapp/AI_CONTRIBUTOR_PROTOCOL.md)
before generating or modifying a MiniApp. Maintainer acceptance uses
[`docs/miniapp/review-checklist.md`](docs/miniapp/review-checklist.md).

## MiniApp Contributor Workflow

Create and verify a reviewable contributor project with:

```bash
./gradlew createMiniApp -PminiAppId=game.snake -PminiAppName=Snake -PminiAppProfile=game
./gradlew :game:snake:allTests :game:snake:validateMiniAppDependencies
```

`miniAppProfile=game` is optional but recommended for games. It generates a
small immutable `GameState`/typed `GameAction`/pure `GameEngine` seam plus
focused engine and component tests; its `Tick` action is only a placeholder
for game-owned rules. Omit the profile for the smaller basic scaffold.

The task accepts only direct `:game:<name>` and
`:miniapp:samples:<name>` paths (or the matching explicit
`-PminiAppProjectPath`), never overwrites an existing project, and writes
through a sibling staging directory. Discovery makes every project under
`game/*` and `miniapp/samples/*` independently buildable on the next Gradle
invocation. There is no server, runtime catalog download or remote plugin
loading.

Generated projects apply only `logica.miniapp`. That convention supplies KMP, Compose resources, Metro, one direct `:miniapp:metro` framework edge, reusable `:miniapp:audio-presets` as an implementation dependency, and dependency-boundary validation. Contributors can use `MiniAppSessionContext.audio` and shared audio presets without declaring audio dependencies. They may use stable `:miniapp:*` contracts and the allowed inward core contracts, but must not depend on feature, application, concrete game/sample, data/telemetry, native-ad modules, platform audio APIs or external audio engines. Use `:miniapp:compose MiniAppInterstitialCapability` rather than `:monetization:ads`.

Do not inject or call the legacy `AudioRepository` from a generated MiniApp.
Its bundled-file path is retained only for Block Blast and is not part of the
contributor contract.

Generated `@GraphExtension.Factory` methods are namespaced from the complete
MiniApp ID (for example, `createGameSnakeSessionGraph`). Preserve that naming:
Kotlin cannot merge factories that differ only by return type when multiple
MiniApps are aggregated into the same native application graph. Each child
graph exposes its concrete session type instead of a qualified
`MiniAppSession`; this keeps sibling bindings distinct without `@Named` strings.

Discovery and shipping are intentionally separate: a scaffold becomes
discoverable on the next Gradle invocation, but only an exact
`miniApps.include(projectPath, expectedId)` entry ships it. A maintainer adds
that single allowlist entry only after review. Never treat discovery as
production authorization.

Plugins depend inward on MiniApp contracts and typed capabilities, never on
features, application modules or SDK adapters. Every active plugin creates one
`MiniAppSessionScope` child graph retained by its `MiniAppSession` handle. Root
owns Catalog/Running navigation, Settings/Review, Back, visibility and stale
callback rejection. Block Blast owns resume/new-game choice,
Playing/Result/Revive, persistence and any future Replay behavior.

Use `MiniAppSessionContext.storage` for every new persistent value or versioned
snapshot. Block Blast's existing `blockblast.game_save`,
`blockblast.best_score` and `blockblast.tutorial_seen` physical keys are
declared as compatibility aliases and must not be migrated merely to satisfy
the new convention. Plugins cannot provide Catalog
cards, host Back/Settings controls, the host toolbar, ad containers or Replay
actions. Replay is deliberately absent from the initial public MiniApp API.

## MiniApp Procedural Audio Authoring

When creating, changing, reviewing or diagnosing Music/SFX in a MiniApp, read
`.agents/skills/miniapp-procedural-audio/SKILL.md` and follow its routed
references. Human authors start at `docs/miniapp/audio/getting-started.md`.
The complete public-author documentation is under `docs/miniapp/audio/`.

Follow this order: reuse a declaration from `:miniapp:audio-presets`; tune its
public name/seed/gain/density/stereo controls; compose renamed presets; create
an original game-owned declaration only when the required role still cannot be
expressed. Do not transcribe Klang, Strudel, commercial music, game soundtracks
or third-party demo compositions. An 8/16/32/64-bit request describes an
aesthetic implemented with synthesis constraints and bit-crush/sample-rate
effects; platform output remains high-quality PCM.

Audio programs are immutable game-owned declarations outside Compose UI.
Receive the session-bound `MiniAppAudio` through `MiniAppSessionContext`/Metro,
use typed control and SFX names, handle command rejection, and let host
visibility, settings and lifecycle own suppression and teardown. MiniApps must
not import audio `internal` packages, `MiniAppAudioEngine`, platform sinks or
native players. Compile every documented/example declaration in `commonTest`;
new voices and presets should add deterministic acoustic render assertions.

On iOS, scheduling, command consumption, DSP work and any associated allocation
belong exclusively to the session producer side. The native audio callback must
only drain the fixed PCM ring, copy through preallocated channel buffers and
update atomic diagnostics; it must never acquire lifecycle locks or reach the
runtime, scheduler or renderer directly.

The maintainer architecture is recorded in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-23-kotlin-pattern-audio-design.md`; staged work
and verification live in
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-23-miniapp-procedural-audio.md`. These are
maintainer references, not authorization for contributors to modify the engine.

The catalog uses a centered `Logica` app bar and an adaptive grid: one column
below 840 dp and two columns at or above it, capped at 1200 dp. Each host-owned
clickable card contains one Material 3 `ListItem` and launches the MiniApp as a
single action; it contains no nested Play button or trailing affordance. The
manifest exposes no cover art or per-game catalog colors. Details dialogs,
context menus, Share actions and deep links are not part of the catalog UI.

## Source Placement and Architecture

- Put portable Kotlin in `commonMain`; keep tests in the matching `commonTest`
  source set unless a platform API is under test.
- Put Android-specific Kotlin and SDK calls in `androidMain` or `androidApp`.
- Put iOS-specific Kotlin in `iosMain` and native Swift/SwiftUI lifecycle code
  in `iosApp/iosApp`.
- Keep UI rendering in Compose or SwiftUI views. Business rules, persistence,
  service lookup, routing decisions and domain mutation belong outside views.
- Preserve the existing Decompose, MVIKotlin and Metro patterns. Their presence
  in the catalog is not authorization to introduce unrelated infrastructure.
- Keep `expect`/`actual` contracts small and platform-neutral. Prefer a common
  implementation when no platform API is required.
- Do not bypass the consent gate when changing advertising. Android requests
  require UMP permission; iOS runs ATT first and then UMP. Mobile Ads
  initialization and ad loading must remain behind the combined gate.

## Code Discovery

When codebase-memory MCP tools are available, use them in this order:

1. `search_graph` to find functions, classes, variables and entry points.
2. `trace_path` to inspect callers, callees, dependencies and data flow.
3. `get_code_snippet` after resolving the exact qualified name.
4. `query_graph` for structural questions that need a graph query.
5. `get_architecture` for a high-level repository map.

Use `rg` for string literals, error messages, configuration values,
documentation and files not indexed by the graph. Re-index after material
structural changes.

## Dependencies and Build Logic

- Declare versions and external artifacts in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`.
- Declare project dependencies in the consuming module's `build.gradle.kts`.
- Put shared KMP configuration in `build-logic/convention`; keep one-off module
  configuration local.
- The shared Compose convention supplies Material 3 Adaptive to `commonMain` and
  Compose UI testing to `commonTest` for Compose modules.
  Reusable breakpoint and pane policy belongs in `:core:uikit`; games consume the
  shared `AdaptiveGameScaffold` instead of redefining size classes or layout modes.
- Keep settings-phase MiniApp discovery in the isolated
  `build-logic/miniapp-settings` plugin artifact so applying it in root settings
  does not place project convention plugin descriptors on the build classpath.
  Its public shipping-model types are the compileOnly contract for later
  build-logic consumers.
- The convention plugin configures JDK 17, Android and iOS ARM64/simulator
  targets for its KMP library modules. Check a module's build file before
  assuming an additional target exists.
- Build-logic plugin bytecode has a narrower compatibility boundary: the
  settings-only MiniApp contract targets Java 17, while the convention artifact
  targets Java 21 because applying Metro 1.4.1 requires its Java 21 Gradle
  plugin. This does not change the app KMP JDK target.
- Preserve type-safe project accessors and Gradle repository configuration in
  `settings.gradle.kts`.
- Never edit generated build output or local-machine configuration.

## Verification

Run commands from the repository root with the checked-in Gradle wrapper. Run
the narrowest relevant task first, then broaden verification as appropriate.

```

For changes to the advertising adapter, also compile its iOS target and verify
the generated SwiftPM linkage package:

```bash
./gradlew :monetization:ads:compileKotlinIosSimulatorArm64
XCODEPROJ_PATH="$PWD/iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj" \
  ./gradlew :composeApp:integrateLinkagePackage -i
```

For changes to the SwiftUI host, Xcode project, signing, iOS Firebase or iOS
ad SDKs, also validate the appropriate Xcode scheme and simulator. Gradle
framework linking does not validate the complete native iOS application.

## Change Discipline

- Inspect neighboring code and tests before selecting names, packages or
  patterns. Add or update tests for changed behavior.
- Keep changes scoped to the request; do not add speculative abstractions,
  dependencies or feature scaffolding.
- Preserve unrelated working-tree changes.
- Do not modify `.gradle/`, `.idea/`, `.kotlin/`, `build/`, `local.properties`,
  `xcuserdata`, or `.DS_Store` as source work.
- Do not expose, commit, regenerate or casually edit credentials and release
  configuration such as keystores, `google-services.json`, Google service
  plists, signing environment variables or private keys.
- Report the exact verification commands executed and any platform work that
  remains unverified.

## Maintaining This Guide

Update `AGENTS.md` in the same change whenever modules, targets, source
placement, dependency direction, app entry points, architecture conventions or
standard verification commands change. Keep `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` as
thin pointers to this file.
